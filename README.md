# Parsetime

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gophreak/parsetime)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gophreak/parsetime)

The parsetime package is designed as a helper to get around the obscurity of Go's time parsing. Coming from a PHP
background I find it easier to implement the standards laid out by PHP so I have created this helper to help when parsing
or formatting times.

## Getting started

Download the package using glide by adding the following into your glide.yaml file

```
import:
- package: github.com/gophreak/parsetime
  repo: git@github.com:gophreak/parsetime.git
  vcs: git
```

Then run `glide up -v` to install the package.

## Using the package

There are two exported functions available for use. `Parse(format, value string)` and `Format(t time.Time, format string)`.

The Parse function will parse a date format and a date value as arguments and return a time in the format of `time.Time`
and an `error` in the event that there was an error parsing the date.

The Format function will format a `time.Time` structure in the format given, and return a string representative of the 
time in the format requested.

Samples of date can be found below:

```
// Days
'd': Day of month (01, 02, 03, ... 30, 31, etc)
'j': Day of month with single digit (1, 2, 3, ... 10, 11, etc)
'D': Day of week - shortname (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc)
'l': Day of week - name (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc)

// Months
'F': Month - Full name (January, February, March, etc)
'M': Month - Short name (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc)
'm': Month number (01, 02, 03, ... 11, 12)
'n': Month number - Single digit (1, 2, 3, ... 11, 12)

// Years
'Y': Year (2006, 2015, 2016, etc) 
'y': Year in two digits (06, 09, 11, 17, etc)

// Time
'a': Morning or evening in AM/PM format
'A': Morning or evening in AM/PM format
'h': Hour number in 12 hour format (1 - 12)
'H': Hour number in 24 hour format (0 - 23)
'i': Minute number (00 - 60)
's': Second number (00 - 60)
'u': Microseconds (up to 6 digits),

// Timezone
'e': Timezone name (UTC, GMT, etc)
'T': Timezzone offset (Â±07:00)
```

If you would like to escape reserved characters for use during the formatting, you can wrap it in `[]square brackets] to
preserve the individual characters. See some examples below:

## Format Examples

Assuming a time of 24th July 2017, at 09:35:42
### Dates

If you want to print out a date in the format of `Year-Month-Date`, then the following would do that:
```
fmt.Println(parsetime.Format(t, "Y-m-d"))
```
Will print
```
"2017-07-24"
```

### Times
If you wanted to print out the time, with `Hour:Minute:Second`, then use the following:
```
fmt.Println(parsetime.Format(t, "H:i:s"))
```
Will print
```
"09:35:42"
```

### Escaped characters

If you want to print out a date in the format of `Time: Year-Month-DateTHour:Minute:Second`, then you would need to
escape the reserved characters. In this instance, it would be simpler to escape in blocks of words:

```
fmt.Println(parsetime.Format(t, "[Time: ]Y-m-d[T]H:i:s"))
```
Will print
```
"Time: 2017-07-24T09:35:42"
```

## Time manipulation

### GetStartOfDay

Get start of day is a helper function designed to get midnight of the passed date. Useful for when you want to
process from the beginning of a day, and are passed a time.Time object with a time already set.

It takes as argument the time.Time object you wish to return the midnight off.

### GetEndOfDay

Get end of day is a helper function designed to get the the end time of the passed date. It will set the time to
be 1ns to midnight of the following day, meaning you can confidently use it to process an entire day giving you
a nano accuracy equivalent to `< t.addDate(0, 0, 1)` where `t` is the midnight of the date in question.

It takes as argument the time.Time object you wish to return the end of day of.

### InTimeZone

In time zone will return the time.Time object passed as argument in the time zone of the time you pass through. It
is a helper method which does not require you to load the time.Location upfront and will work from a string representation
of the timezone you wish to use.

### ParseWithTimeZone

Parse with time zone effectively runs the Parse and SetTimeZone functions to set a time and the timezone without modifying
the underlying time parsed.

## Time manipulation examples

###  GetStartOfDay

To get the start of the passed date, ie midnight, you can configure a time.Time object with any time set:

```
t := time.Date(2017, 10, 25, 18, 36, 45, 56, time.UTC)
e := parsetime.GetStartOfDay(t)
```

Will set `e` to be equal to:
```
e := time.Date(2017, 10, 25, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
```

###  GetEndOfDay

To get the end of the passed date, ie midnight, you can configure a time.Time object with any time set:

```
t := time.Date(2017, 10, 25, 18, 36, 45, 56, time.UTC)
e := parsetime.GetEndOfDay(t)
```

Will set `e` to be equal to:
```
e := time.Date(2017, 10, 25, 23, 59, 59, 999999999, time.UTC)
```

Hence adding 1 nanosecond `ns` to the time e, will give you midnight of the following day.

```
m := e.Add(time.Nanosecond)
m === time.Date(2017, 10, 26, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
```

### InTimeZone

To return the time modified to the timezone, for example Hong Kong, you can use:
```
t := time.Date(2017, 9, 25, 18, 36, 45, 56, time.UTC)
hkTime, tzErr := parsetime.InTimeZone(t, hongkongName)
```

Which would be the equivalent of doing:
```
hkt, _ := time.LoadLocation("Hongkong")
t := time.Date(2017, 9, 25, 18, 36, 45, 56, time.UTC)
hkTime := t.In(hkt)
```

### ParseWithTimeZone

To read a time into Johannesbur's timezone, without changing the parsed time:
```
t, _ := parsetime.ParseWithTimeZone("Y-m-d[T]H:i:s", "2017-11-24T08:39:15", southAfrica)
```

Should set `t` to the equivalent of:
```
saTZ, _ := time.LoadLocation("Africa/Johannesburg")
t := time.Date(2017, 11, 24, 8, 39, 15, 0, saTZ)
```
